# Frontend Machine Learning Web Service

This README provides instructions for setting up and running the frontend of the machine learning web service.

## Project Structure

```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

The frontend application interacts with the backend API to make predictions using the machine learning model. Ensure that the API is running before using the frontend.
